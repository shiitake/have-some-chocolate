    <releaseNotes>##TextPad 9.5.0 (9-Jun-2024)##
Enhancements:

* More themes are available for customizing the appearance of the user interface.
* Scripts in languages such as Python, PHP and awk can now be used to edit documents. For more information, see "HOWTOs" in the forum.

Issues resolved:

* If a workspace containing modified new documents was open at the time Windows Update automatically restarted the operating system, when TextPad was restarted, it reported that it could not save backup files for each of the new documents.
* When Windows Update recovered modified files on restart, a separate prompt to reload the file should not have been issued.
* In HTML files, numbers were not syntax highlighted.
* The target document should have been activated when the Tool Output window was closed.
* The dialog box for Manage History Lists could not be resized vertically.
* The Save Configuration command did not save the selected appearance.
* If the option to "Minimize when last document is closed" was set, TextPad was minimized when switching workspaces.
* Macro commands to change the case of selected text only changed the first character, if the default scope of the macro was "Selection".
* Copying text within a single line in block mode should not have appended a newline character.
